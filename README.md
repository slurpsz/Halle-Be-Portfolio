# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## DESCRIPTION

Portfolio are made for employers to view a person's skills and to determine whether they are a suitable candidate. It contains information about the person, projects, and contact information. Portfolio can always be updated with new current work.

## USAGE

 In this portfolio, the navbar directs to the appropriate section when clicked on. If the cursor is hovered over any of the links, the font color will be pink and the cursor switches to a different style. Under projects section, when the image is hovered, it will appear larger than the others. The current images are linked as placeholders at the moment until more projects are added. Contact links will direct users to the corresponding page. Media query is implemented to make it mobile friendly and able to view in multiply devices. If page is resized to 768px or less, the navbar will be hidden.
 
 Things I would love to add in the future is a Click to Top button.

## CHALLENGES

  Some challenges I ran into while making this portfolio was aligning my containers into the center. I also had an issue with adding into the repository.
  A warning message appeared but was resolved with some help from askBCS Learning Assistant.
